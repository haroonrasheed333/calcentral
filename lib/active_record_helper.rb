module ActiveRecordHelper

  # The justification for doing atomic wrapping around each database call with use_pooled_connection
  # is due to our preference of holding on to connections for the shortest time possible. Due to the way
  # our app is structured, following the standard rails scheme of wrapping the with_connection at a much higher
  # level would cause certain connections to be held for much longer than we would like (while waiting for proxy
  # call responses, doing transform on data), while having nothing to do with the database. By doing wrapping at
  # a more atomic level, we can help avoid the overconsumption of connections and sitting idle when some other
  # request can't obtain db connections.
  #
  # One idea to pursue is to have a method that helps act as a proxy call to built in ActiveRecord database calls
  # that will automatically wrap it up with the "with_connection" proc. That should help reduce some of the
  # noise floating around in all the different levels of the app with the with_pooled_connection blocks. Another
  # idea is to possibly follow the example of the activerecord-wrap-with-connection gem, and have it "autowrap"
  # at a much higher level.
